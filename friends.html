            <p>
              As I mentioned earlier, I enjoy playing football. It's not just me; my friends in Klang also love playing football. So, we formed a team that includes my friends, and we participate in the league.
            </p>
            <p>
              My friends and I have always shared a passion for football. It's something we played together constantly. Football was the activity that brought us all together during our childhood, creating strong bonds and countless memories.
            </p>
            <p>
              Growing up, football was the thread that wove our friendships together. Every afternoon, we’d meet on the field, eager to play and compete. Those games were more than just sport; they were the foundation of our camaraderie and the highlight of our childhood.
            </p>
            <p>
              ps; I'm in the middle of the picture.

            <h3>Playing futsal with friends.</h3>
            <p class="fst-italic">
              Every evening we plays futsal if its not raining.
            </p>
            <p>
              Every evening, my friends and I gather to play futsal. It's become our daily routine, a time we all look forward to. The fast-paced matches and the laughter we share on the court strengthen our friendship and keep us connected.
            </p>
            <p>
              The bonds we’ve formed on the futsal court transcend the game itself, fostering a deep sense of trust and understanding. The sound of the ball, the shouts of encouragement, and the shared victories and losses are all part of the memories we are creating together. Playing futsal every evening isn't just a hobby; it's a cherished tradition that solidifies our friendship and brings us closer with every match.
            </p>
            <p>
              My friends and I are always thrilled to play futsal together. The joy and excitement we feel on the court are unmatched. Every game is filled with laughter, high energy, and a sense of camaraderie that strengthens our friendship. Playing futsal is our favorite way to spend time together, creating happy memories that we cherish.

              My friends that are always with me since the first time I'm in Kedah.
            </p>
            <p>
              Faizal, Anieq, and Ameer are my best friends, and they have never left me behind. Since the first semester, through every challenge and obstacle, they have always been there to support me. No matter the problem, I can always count on Faizal, Anieq, and Ameer to have my back. Their unwavering friendship and loyalty have been a constant source of strength and comfort throughout my journey.
            </p>
            <p>
              Kolej Malinja A110 was where our friendship story began. Faizal and Anieq were my roommates, and Ameer was in the same class as me. One day, I invited Ameer to join us in our room, and from that moment, our bond grew stronger. We spent countless hours playing games together, sharing laughter, and opening up about our worries and troubles. Our friendship blossomed in that small room, as we supported each other through the ups and downs of college life.
            </p>
            <p>
              Even as I approach my last semester of studies, I know that I will never leave Faizal, Anieq, and Ameer behind. They have become an integral part of my life, my pillars of support and companionship. I am immensely grateful to have them by my side, and I thank God every day for bringing them into my life. They are not just friends; they are family, and their friendship is something I will cherish forever.

            <h3>My Classmates</h3>
            <p>My classmates are more than just fellow students; they are a diverse and vibrant community that enriches my educational journey. Each one brings their own unique perspective, experiences, and talents to the classroom, making every interaction dynamic and engaging. Together, we navigate the challenges of our studies, sharing knowledge, supporting each other, and celebrating our achievements. Beyond academics, we forge friendships that extend beyond the classroom walls, creating memories and bonds that will last a lifetime. My classmates inspire me, challenge me, and remind me that learning is not just about textbooks and exams, but also about the connections we make along the way.
            </p>
            <p>
              Even though I may not know much about my classmates personally, their presence in the classroom never fails to uplift me. The healthy competition in learning that they bring motivates me to strive for excellence in my studies. Seeing their dedication and enthusiasm pushes me to work harder and achieve my academic goals. Their encouragement and support create an environment where we all can thrive and grow together. I am grateful for the positive impact they have on my academic journey, and their cheering presence reminds me that we are all in this together.
