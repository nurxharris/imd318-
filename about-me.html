            <h3>Early life.</h3>
            <p class="fst-italic">
              Just a little kid in Klang.
            </p>
            <p>
              February 14, 2003, I was born. I come from a family with six siblings, and I am the third child. And the photo on the right shows me as a youngster. I was born in Kuala Lumpur and grew up in Klang. When you look at the photo on this side, it seems like time has flown by. 
              I didn't suppose this small guy had grown up to want to make his mother and father proud. Growing up, every milestone, every step forward, has been a testament to the love and support of my parents. That small, innocent face in the photo embodies the dreams 
              and hopes of a bright future, dreams that have fueled my determination to succeed.
            </p>
            <p>
              From a young age, I was curious and eager to learn, traits that were nurtured by my loving parents. They provided me with a supportive environment where education and hard work were highly valued. My parents' dedication and sacrifices were instrumental in fostering a 
              strong sense of responsibility and ambition within me.
            </p>
            <p>
              Reflecting on those early years, I realize how pivotal they were in shaping my path forward. The values instilled in me during my childhood have been the foundation of my journey, driving me to strive for excellence and to make my parents proud.

            <h3>I love to play football.</h3>
            <p class="fst-italic">
              Cristiano Ronaldo wannabe!!!
            </p>
            <p>
              From a young age, I have been deeply passionate about football. This enthusiasm stems from growing up in a family that values sports in daily life. Take my father, for instance. In his younger years, he explored various sports such as football, hockey, 
              and sepak takraw. Even now, approaching 60, he remains actively involved in tennis.
            </p>
            <p>
              I began playing football at the age of 7 when my brother and his friends invited me to join their games. This is when my passion for the sport ignited. I also spent a lot of time watching my idol at the time, Cristiano Ronaldo, and admiring his playing 
              style. He was playing for Manchester United then, a club I have loved ever since.
            </p>
            <p>
              I sincerely wished that CR7 wouldn't transfer to Real Madrid at that time, but unfortunately, things didn't turn out the way I hoped.

            <h3>I love photo shooting of myself & fashion.</h3>
            <p class="fst-italic">
              Thrifting, capturing photos, trying something new.
            </p>
            <p>
              I have always had a passion for photography, particularly capturing images of myself. There's something incredibly fulfilling about expressing myself through photos, experimenting with different poses, angles, and settings. Fashion, too, plays a significant role in this passion. I love exploring new styles, blending trends with my personal taste, and using fashion as a form of self-expression. 
              Together, photography and fashion allow me to showcase my creativity and individuality, telling my unique story through every image.
            </p>
            <p>
              As I mentioned earlier, I have a passion for fashion, and most of my clothes come from thrifting. I deeply love thrifting; there's an excitement in sifting through racks of pre-loved items and uncovering unique pieces with their own stories. Thrifting allows me to find stylish, distinctive clothes at a fraction of the cost, while also aligning with my commitment to sustainability. Each thrifted 
              piece adds a unique touch to my wardrobe, seamlessly blending the past with the present in a way that's both fashionable and eco-friendly.

            <h3>I love attending concerts.</h3>
            <p>The image on the left depicts me and a friend attending a concert in Penang featuring the Indonesian band Fourtwnty. The concert name was Nalar Tour Album. I initiated the invitation for us to go together because we share a mutual interest in the band. One of the main reasons I admire Fourtwnty is their music, which frequently incorporates calming melodies, heartfelt lyrics, and memorable hooks, resulting in a unique sound that 
              connects with audiences.
            </p>
            <p>
              The band gained popularity through their engaging live performances and the release of their debut album "Lelaku" in 2015, which featured hit singles like "Aku Tenang" and "Zona Nyaman". Their music often explores themes of love, life, and self-discovery, with lyrics that are introspective and relatable to many. The following is one of the songs from Fourtwnty:
